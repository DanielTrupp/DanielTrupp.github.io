### Software Engineering

My interest in software engineering is primarily focused on how I can automate or make things easier for myself. Ideally, I am trying to go into the field of data science after college, where the amount of software development will be variable. My hope is that by that time I will have all the necissary skills needed to simplify any task, be it analysis, cleaning, or setting up preformatted documents. By learning software engineering, I hope to broaden my current skill set in the hopes that it will not only enhance my skill set, but also prepare me for developing quick programs to simplify work.
