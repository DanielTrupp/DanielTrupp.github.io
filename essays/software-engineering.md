### Software Engineering

My interest in software engineering is primarily focused on how I can automate or make things easier for myself. Ideally, I am trying to go into the field of data science after college, where the amount of software development will be variable. My hope is that by that time I will have all the necissary skills needed to simplify any task, be it analysis, cleaning, or setting up preformatted documents. By learning software engineering, I hope to broaden my current skill set in the hopes that it will not only enhance my skill set, but also prepare me for developing quick programs to simplify work.

Going forward, I would like to both improve my ability to write programs quickly, and have those programs function/be able to fix them if they break. This coupled with data set knowlidge could allow me to either format data properly for analysis, clean data sets, or just find and extract values I'm interesed in. Using more coding languages also helps me prepare for different syntax, allowing for better adaptability. This would help in the case where I am presented with a uniqu set of code/software that I have to use as part of a project. Beyond that, I just seek to improve my coding skill and practice problem solving.

### Data Science

I hope to apply the techniques I hone in this class to my future endevors in data science. While it is not necissarily strongly coupled with software engineering, I know that developing these skills will help downstream when I need a quick program to simplify a job. I'm not super passionate about software engineering, but I look forward to using the skills I hone and the knowlidge I learn to further my own interests.
