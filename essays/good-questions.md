A key part of programming is troubleshooting. Whether it be a minor bug or strange behavior, you're likely to have questions if you spend time programming. Some problems will be solved by rereading your code aloud to a rubber duck (or convient friend), but others will prove too vexing to just puzzle through. Thankfully, we have the internet, and the ability to search problems online. In many cases, problems aren't totally unique and someone else has had the exact same problem or one very similar to it. In those cases, it'll pop up at the top of the suggestions in the search engine of your choice, usually on the website, stackoverflow. There will be some cases however, where the problem you are looking for has yet to be identified by someone else. Those cases will have you being the poster to stackoverflow, and others answering your inquery.

### Asking Good Questions

Probably the best thing to learn is how to ask questions in a way that will let them get answered. Questions that are descriptive and clear generally get good informative feedback. Additionally, questions that ask why are likely to be answered well, while questions asking how may have varying levels of quality to their answer. 
A good why question can be seen at [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array/11227902#11227902](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array/11227902#11227902), where the user is asking about a strange behavior they observed in their code. The find that a certain code block runs significantly faster on sorted data rather then unsorted data, which is consistant across multiple programming languages. They provide the code snippets they ran, and stated the times they achieved. The user also asks clear questions of what is happening to get this outcome and why is it happening. Their post has an incredably detailed and explanitive answer to it describing branch prediction in a concice, easy-to-understand way.
