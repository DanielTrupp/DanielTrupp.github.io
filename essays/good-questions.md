A key part of programming is troubleshooting. Whether it be a minor bug or strange behavior, you're likely to have questions if you spend time programming. Some problems will be solved by rereading your code aloud to a rubber duck (or convient friend), but others will prove too vexing to just puzzle through. Thankfully, we have the internet, and the ability to search problems online. In many cases, problems aren't totally unique and someone else has had the exact same problem or one very similar to it. In those cases, it'll pop up at the top of the suggestions in the search engine of your choice, usually on the website, stackoverflow. There will be some cases however, where the problem you are looking for has yet to be identified by someone else. Those cases will have you being the poster to stackoverflow, and others answering your inquery.

### Asking Good Questions

Probably the best thing to learn is how to ask questions in a way that will let them get answered.
