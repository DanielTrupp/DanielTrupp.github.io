### The Bread and Butter of Computer Science

The thing that makes computer science unique, and arguably its best feature is code reusability. The ability to come up with a general solution to a problem and specifically apply it allows for future, similar problems to be solved immediatly. Code reusability is a feature derived from design patterens. Design patterens are exxentially one further level of abstraction above code reusability. Instead of being a solution to a problem in code, they are a description of a problem, and a description of a way to solve it. While not origionating in computer science (the idea comes from archetexture), the concept of design patterns has become a core component of it, and such solutions are often applied beofore an individual learns that they are design patterns. 

The concept has evolved since its introduction. While many design patterns show optimal solutions to problems, some design patterns exist to show poor ways to solve problems, like using a singleton. While they may be solutions to the problems, they have at least one element to them that makes them either bad to use, for example the use of a global variable, or inefficent compared to a more elegant solution.

### When and Where are they Used

As mentioned before, it is possible for individuals to use design patterns before they know what a design pattern is. I myself only learned the concept last week but I have applied them throughout my time programming.
