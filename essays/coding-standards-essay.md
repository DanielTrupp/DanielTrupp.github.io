/*
Many people think of “coding standards” in a trivial way—i.e. minutae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.

I, on the other hand, think that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Indeed, I believe some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Do you agree?

After your first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, what are your impressions? Are you finding that getting the green checkmark is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?

Write an interesting, informative essay on coding standards that addresses some or all of the above questions, or goes in a different direction entirely regarding coding standards. Make sure it provides your personal perspective and useful insights.

### Coding Standards are Useful

If you have a development environment that can automatically check them for you. If you aren't using an IDE that checks spelling and standards (maybe you're one of those people who likes vim), coding standards can be a real pain to check for. It's really tempting to write poorly, and nothing stops you from doing that. This can lead to code that is difficult to read, which is at least a minor inconvienance, but could slow down a project immensly if there is a problem that has to be manually searced for and corrected. But by using a set style, you can ensure good code readability, and enable rapid bug fixing.
