### Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder

Many people disagree on what something beautiful, but most people can agree what makes a user interface look decent and function well. Creating said interfaces, however, can be time consuming and can produce some very long and confusing code. The primary way to develop websites uses HTML and CSS code to create and style the various aspects of the pages. It is this combination of code that is responsible for the lengthy, confusing webpage code. In order to make this process easier, user interface, or UI, frameworks were developed. These are similar to coding languages in that they have unique syntax, but differ in that they are woven into HTML. They modify styling of elements, often making it easier by simplifying the syntax.
