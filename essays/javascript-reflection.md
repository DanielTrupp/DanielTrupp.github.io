So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

### An Initial Impression

Prior to this class, all I'd heard of Javascript was from memes blasting it as a bad language. Having had a week to learn about the language, I've found it nothing like what I'd herd of the language. It seems rather similar to java in syntax, with minor variations that were inconsequnetial to learning the language. It could be due to the number of languages I've used but I felt the syntax was quite easy to pick up. As my experince with Javascript is only a week long, I may change my opinion if it turns out that there are features of the language that I don't like, but so far my impression of it is good. 

### Learning process

I've learned using modules before, and these modules seemed pretty consistant with the quality of modules I've seen in the past. I think they are good at showing the techniques available from a language, but as with modules, the material really has to be practiced to get a good understanding of what it does and how it works. It seems like is could be a good software engineering language, as it provides some unique and useful benefits, such as the ability to return multiple different types of values from a function. 

The practice WOD's coupled well with the module learning, as it affords more practice with the techniques gained from the modules, but I think is limited by them being assignments. Having additional, optional practice WOD's that cover a wider range of techniques covered by the modules would improve retention and give a better understanding.
