### An Initial Impression

Prior to this class, all I'd heard of Javascript was from memes blasting it as a bad language. Having had a week to learn about the language, I've found it nothing like what I'd herd of the language. It seems rather similar to java in syntax, with minor variations that were inconsequnetial to learning the language. It could be due to the number of languages I've used but I felt the syntax was quite easy to pick up. As my experince with Javascript is only a week long, I may change my opinion if it turns out that there are features of the language that I don't like, but so far my impression of it is good. 

### The Learning process

I've learned using modules before, and these modules seemed pretty consistant with the quality of modules I've seen in the past. I think they are good at showing the techniques available from a language, but as with modules, the material really has to be practiced to get a good understanding of what it does and how it works. It seems like is could be a good software engineering language, as it provides some unique and useful benefits, such as the ability to return multiple different types of values from a function. 

The practice WOD's coupled well with the module learning, as it affords more practice with the techniques gained from the modules, but I think is limited by them being assignments. Having additional, optional practice WOD's that cover a wider range of techniques covered by the modules would improve retention and give a better understanding. I personally don't particularly like the modular learning, but find the WODs to be a worthwhile test of skill. I think that I can make almost any learning scheme work, but I prefer lectures over modular learning with the caviat that the lecturer actually likes the topic and wants to teach it.
